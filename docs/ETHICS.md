# Ethics & Safety

- **Accessibility**: Mislabeling harms screen-reader users. Prefer accurate alt-text in public contexts.
- **Platform policies**: Some hosts forbid deceptive metadata/filenames. Comply with local rules.
- **Research framing**: Position poisoning as anti-scraping research; include clear toggles and undo.
- **Default path**: "Clean to Safe Upload" should be the recommended default for everyday users.
