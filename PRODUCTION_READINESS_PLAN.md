2. **Documentation** (2 weeks) - Essential for user adoption  
3. **Packaging** (2 weeks) - Required for distribution
4. **Community Setup** (1 week) - Enables sustainable growth

**Total Timeline**: 9-12 weeks to production-ready open source release

The project's ethical approach, comprehensive feature set, and modern architecture position it well for success in the privacy-focused photography community. With proper execution of this plan, the Metadata Multitool can become a leading open source solution for metadata management and privacy protection.
